## Quotetionary
### Summary
The assignment was to create a React app rendered in a web browser, with data consumed from a public API, in a paired team within a day and a half.
For the MVP version, we choose to make a quote bank app, with the following features supported:
- Users can pull a single random quote.
- Display all quotes available in the API on a single page.
 - Filter quotes by:
   - Tag
   - Author
We also defined some stretch goals/additional feature ideas whilst brainstorming:
- Infinite scrolling
- Search by keyword
- Like/Dislike button
 - Where 'Like' adds more quotes from the same author, displayed at the top of all the quotes.
 - Where 'Dislike' removes the quote to be displayed.
- Pick a random quote from the selected tag.
- Consolidate current API data with an additional API to augment UX.
Once the scope of our tasks was defined, we proceeded to draw wireframes, then to build the MVP.
 
The constraints of the project were to build linearly as a pair, without contributing through GitHub, with the possibility to use Live Share. What we ended up doing is working together on the same components, occasionally splitting tasks but mainly coding components together, using a conferencing app to communicate and share screens as well as Live Sharing our editor.

### Pages
1. Home page
2. Random Quote
3. Quotes

### Functionalities
#### API request & Local Storage
Below, we are making multiple API requests into one function and saving the result into local storage. This way there isn't a need to make these requests every page load, since it isn't a priority to display new quotes across the array of 8k+ quote objects to users.

```js
export async function getApiData() {
 try {
   const getQuotesRes = await getQuotes()
   const getTagsRes = await getAllTags()
   let quoteId = 0
   const quotes = getQuotesRes.data.quotes
   const tags = getTagsRes.data.tags
   const newQuotes = quotes.map(quote => {
     quoteId++
     return { ...quote, id: quoteId }
   })
   localStorage.setItem('quotes', JSON.stringify(newQuotes))
   localStorage.setItem('tags', JSON.stringify(tags))
   return false
 } catch (err) {
   return true
 }
}
```

### Get/Display a Random Quote
The function below generates a random index within the array of quotes `quotesArray` pulled from the API, on the condition that `quotesArray` is not null (by implementing `!!`, the variable will return a boolean result whether data is null or available).

```js
 const [randomQuote, setRandomQuote] = React.useState(
   !!quotesArray &&
   quotesArray[Math.floor(Math.random() * quotesArray.length)])
 const handleClick = () => {
   setRandomQuote(quotesArray[Math.floor(Math.random() * quotesArray.length)])
 }
```

#### Filter hook
On the Quote page (allQuotes.js), quotes are filtered using a custom hook `useFilter(searchData)`, where `searchData` represents the array of quote objects to be iterated through for filtering. By default, `filteredQuotes` returns the full array called from the API, when no filters are selected. This way, it can be used as a single endpoint for data display, without having to use conditionals.

Here's the `useFilter()` hook:

```js
 const handleChange = e => {
   setSearchForm({ ...searchForm, [e.target.name]: e.target.value })
 }
 function filterQuotes(originalQuotes) {
   const filteredTag = originalQuotes.filter(quote => {
     return (
     quote.tag === searchForm.tag
     || searchForm.tag === 'All')
   )
   }
   const filteredAuthor = filteredTag.filter(quote => {
    return (
       quote.author.toLowerCase().includes(searchForm.searchField.toLowerCase())
       || searchForm.searchField === '')
    )
   }
   setFilteredQuotes(filteredAuthor)
   return filteredAuthor
 }
```

#### Infinite scroll
8k+ quotes were too much to display at once, and we wanted to give a go at infinite scrolling - displaying 10 quotes by default/per scroll - since it is currently widely used by many websites.

First, we had to set `handleScroll` to detect the bottom of the page, then slice the array of quotes to load by increments of 10 indexes:

```js
const handleScroll = ({ target }) => {
 if (target.scrollHeight - target.scrollTop === target.clientHeight) {
   setLoadingArray(filteredQuotes.slice(0, currentLoad + loadingHeight))
   setCurrentLoad(currentLoad + loadingHeight)
 }
}
```

Then, in useEffect(),

```js
if (filteredQuotes) {
 setLoadingArray(filterQuotes(quotes).slice(0, loadingHeight))
 setCurrentLoad(loadingHeight)
 const target = document.getElementById('AllQuotes')
 target.scrollTop = 0
}
```

`target.scrollTop = 0` allows for each filter change to take the user to the page's default state: at the top of the page (a bit of UX magic there).
At last, `loadingArray` is the final endpoint to display the quotes within the pages' function return value.

### Challenges
The main challenge was to work through the project linearly as a pair where we were taking turns to code, as opposed to working separately on different components or parts of a component.
 
Additionally, the timeframe to complete a project felt short since React was yet very new to us.
 
### Wins
I'm pleased with the final result of our output and my contribution towards the project. Also, that I managed to create and implement my first hook `useFilter.js` is gratifying. I think that it was a great exercise to consolidate recent learnings and feel more confidence to code in React.
 
### Key Learnings
#### Version Control
We hit a few bottlenecks in terms of collaborating onto the same document. I definitely value the importance of working from the same repository and handling version control.

#### Debugging
With React, I felt a lot more comfortable console logging each step at the time, rather than jumping steps by typing bigger chunks of code at once. But debugging custom hooks proved to be a bit trickier than synchronous & asynchronous functions.

#### Multiple API calls into one function
The syntax was new to me and it wasn't a straightforward job to consolidate the API calls together and debug the function. Breaking code was a useful operation to understand the moving parts of a call.

#### Team work makes the dream work
I believe it's very important to define ahead of coding all of the necessary steps to complete a project (e.g. defining the app specifications, sudo coding, github), to split tasks between developers in an efficient manner, and to be agile with project's management. Without these steps, it is easy to waste time and resources to solve problems which could've been identified and/or avoided during the planning process.
